# A game for 7DRL-2013

## About
This is a tower defence roguelike game for [7DRL-2013](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=7DRL_Challenge_2013). It is written in Python using [libtcod](http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/).

## Running
Tested on Linux only. The code should run on Windows but I haven't tested it (due to project failure), and Windows libtcod runtime is not included.

To run, execute: 
```bash
cd 7drl2013
python run.py
```
